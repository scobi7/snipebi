SNIPING BOTTTTTT

1. pull the following parameters of certain CA's:
    -signature
    -TVL (total value locked)
    -volume
    -holders
    -24hr trades
    -etc

Done with this for the most part. I cannot access most of the parameters.
Just the pricing and 24hr vol change. Need to figure out how to get more in order to train a model to decide on coins. Also I think Helius is just outputting most recent coins put on DEXSCREENER so I need some filtering

2. analyze data and find a coin to buy
    -buy 3 top memes of the day after data analysis
    -use models to decide which to buy
    -could also use https://gmgn.ai/?chain=sol to verify wallet accuracy

3. decide or develop a trading strategy for profit
    -scalping?
    -swing trade
    -pump n dump
